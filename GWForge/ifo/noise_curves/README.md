The Cosmic Explorer (CE) interferometer design is defined by two independent choices: i) the circulating optical power in the arm cavities--which may be set to either 1 megawatt or 1.5 megawatts, and ii) mirror coating technology--either advanced LIGO (aLIGO) or A+ coating. These choices generate four design cases for both the 20 km and the 40 km CE interferometer. Figure ![CE_tech_sensitivity_curves.png](./CE_tech_sensitivity_curves.png) shows the noise amplitude spectral density (ASD) for these design choices. 

Raising the circulating power from 1 MW to 1.5 MW improves mid- and high-frequency sensitivity (from ~20 Hz to 5000 Hz), but adds extra heat that must be managed. Upgrading the mirrors from aLIGO coating to A+ coating majorly improves low- and mid-band sensitivity (from ~9 Hz to ~600 Hz for CE 20 and to ~400 Hz for CE 40) by reducing coating thermal noise.  Thus, 1.5 MW + A+ coating maximizes sensitivity, whereas the 1 MW + aLIGO pairing minimizes development risk.
